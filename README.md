# Architectures

## Separation of Concerns (SoC) / Modular Architecture

A fundamental principle of software engineering that emphasizes the importance of dividing a system into distinct modules or components, each with a specific and independent responsibility.

For this project, SoC was implemented using a modular architecture, where each module is responsible for a single task or functionality.

## Dependency Injection (DI)

In Clean Architecture, dependencies are injected, which means the higher-level modules should depend on lower-level modules. This ensures that the business logic is not coupled with the infrastructure details.

For this task, this architecture was implemtented at the database level to enable testing and database mocking.

# Assumptions

These are some assumptions made when developing this application:

- Projects already exists in the system.
- The Admin user already exists in the system.
- The system is a passwordless application.
- All lesson videos are youtube videos.
- This application is only to be used on a desktop screen (no compatibility with mobile screens).

# Setup

## Installation

Pre-requisite: Make sure you have [docker][dc] setup on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ebukaodini/task-mgt.git
```

2. Setup environment variables:

```bash
$ cp api/.env.sample api/.env
$ cp app/.env.sample app/.env 
```

3. Build the docker image and spin up services:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Usage

Open the application on your browser:

## Credentials

These are the default accounts seeded into the database. Use them for different the roles.

- admin@example.com - `ADMIN`
- john.doe@example.com - `USER`
- jane.doe@example.com - `USER`
